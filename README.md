## Report abstract
I was a software engineer assistant during 8 months, from July 2014 to February 2015, as part as my B.Eng. formation, in a start-up who develop 360° video capturing and editing software. I was part of a small Scrum team.

I have contributed to improve the architecture of three software: Several redundant code was needed to be shared between the different software of the company. I have then successfully integrated two new products. 
Finally, it allowed me to refactored the workflow of the team to make it simpler and more effective to use: To set-up a new machine with a ready environment development costs 3 time less.

As my second task, I have successfully integrated five video/audio acquisition cards to the software by developing plugins. These increased the IO capabilities of the software.
As in charge of this software module, I had been in contact with the support and the technical teams of two of the five companies. I had also ensured a customer support, and improved the IO capabilities following the customer returns.

Finally, I have made some minor improvements on the HCI of the software, and enhanced the support of the virtual head-mounted reality Oculus Rift.
